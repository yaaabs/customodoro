# 🚀 **Customodoro Admin Dashboard Implementation Plan**

## 📋 **COPY-PASTE PROMPT FOR COPILOT**

**Please implement a secure admin dashboard for my Customodoro app following the comprehensive plan in this ADMIN.md file. I need a modern, glassmorphism-styled admin interface that shows user emails, usernames, statistics (current streak, longest streak with date ranges, focus points, session counts), and system analytics - all while ensuring ZERO user data modification capabilities and bulletproof data protection. The implementation should include: (1) Backend API routes with JWT authentication in customodoro-backend repository, (2) Read-only database queries with comprehensive audit logging, (3) Responsive admin dashboard with real-time statistics, (4) User search/filtering with masked emails for privacy, (5) Data export functionality, and (6) Complete security measures including rate limiting and session management. Follow the team roles, technical architecture, and safety measures outlined in this document exactly - this is a production app with real users so data integrity is CRITICAL. Start with Phase 1 backend development, ensure all admin operations are read-only, implement proper authentication, and create the foundation for a secure admin system that can monitor 10,000+ users without any risk of data corruption.**

## 🎯 **Project Brief**

**Create a secure, modern admin dashboard for Customodoro that allows monitoring user accounts, viewing detailed statistics (streaks, focus points, sessions), and managing user data without compromising security or existing functionality. This implementation must be bulletproof to prevent any user data loss or corruption.**
