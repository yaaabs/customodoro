## **🕛 Reverse Pomodoro Mode – The Flexible Stopwatch**  
Not everyone finds the traditional Pomodoro technique suitable. The **Reverse Pomodoro Mode** is for those who need a more customizable approach to work and breaks, like a stopwatch but with a twist.  

### **How It Works**  
Work for up to **1 hour**, earning a single, accumulated break based on how long you work:  

| **Work Duration** | **Break Time** |  
|--------------------|----------------|  
| 5-20 mins          | 2 min break    |  
| 21-30 mins         | 5 min break   |  
| 31-45 mins         | 10 min break   |  
| 46-55 mins         | 15 min break   |  
| 56-60 mins         | 30 min break   |  

This mode is perfect for those who want more flexibility and control over their workflow. You set the pace, and the breaks adjust accordingly. 💥
