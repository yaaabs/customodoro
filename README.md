New: You can now focus on a task by clicking it, and drag & drop tasks to reorder! This makes shifting priorities and concentrating on a single task simple and tactile.

### 📈 **Productivity Graph (NEW!)**
We've expanded our analytics into a new "Stats & Analytics" suite that includes the original Productivity Graph plus several new stats cards to give you deeper insights into your habits.

 **📅 Productivity Graph (Heatmap)** — The original calendar-style heatmap (contribution-graph inspired) showing focus density over time.
  - My Stats: Total Focus Points, Current Streak, Longest Streak
- **📊 User's Stats Card (Dynamic)** — Personalized stats that update when you sign in:
  - Total Focus Time
  - Completed Sessions
  - Most Productive Day
  - Total Classic Pomodoros
  - Total Reverse Pomodoros
- **🔁 Most Used Pomodoro Card** — A small chart showing which Pomodoro type you use most (Classic vs Reverse).

These cards can be shown together on a dashboard or broken into their own section for advanced users.

### 💾 **Persistent Settings & Data Privacy**
- **🔄 Auto-save Preferences** - Your settings are always remembered
- **🔧 Granular Controls** - Customize every aspect of your timer experience
- **⚡ Quick Reset Options** - Start fresh anytime with one click
- **🔒 Privacy-First** - All data stored locally, no account required

#### Sync Across Devices (Optional)
We provide an opt-in sync feature so you can keep streaks and stats consistent across phones, tablets, and computers. Syncing is optional — the app remains fully functional without an account and stores data locally by default.

How it works:

1. 1️⃣ Register your email on your PC/Laptop to upload your current stats
2. 2️⃣ Sign in with the same email on your iPad/Phone
3. 3️⃣ Your data automatically syncs after each session!

We take safety seriously: synchronization is opt-in and secured (data is uploaded only when you register and sign in). By default data stays local; if you opt into sync, we keep your stats synchronized across devices while providing clear controls for disconnecting and removing synced data.

## 🎪 **Comprehensive Feature Showcase**

<details>
<summary><strong>🍅 Classic Pomodoro Timer Features</strong></summary>

Classic is the traditional Pomodoro experience reimagined with full customization. It’s perfect when you want strict timeboxing, predictable transitions, and repeatable short work sprints.

- Strengths: predictable flow, great for tasks that benefit from strict timeboxing (coding sprints, study blocks, focused editing).
- Mode behavior: Fixed-length countdown sessions (work, short break, long break).
- Full customization: You can set the Pomodoro, Short Break, and Long Break durations anywhere from 1 minute up to 999 minutes — and save the values as presets.
- Session automation: Auto-start between sessions, configurable session count before a long break, and visual progress indicators.
- Best for: users who prefer regimented sessions, quick resets, and measurable, repeatable progress.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>⏱️ Reverse Pomodoro Timer Features</strong></summary>

Reverse keeps the same UI, themes, and analytics, but changes the timing model: instead of starting with a preset countdown, it counts your focus time and rewards you with breaks.

- Strengths: excellent for open-ended deep work, creative flow, and for users who resist fixed session lengths.
- Two sub-modes:
  - Standard Mode — default behavior with a 1-hour maximum session cap. You can still customize how breaks are awarded (break-tier mapping) and other reward settings; the max cap itself remains fixed in Standard.
  - Dynamic Mode — unlocks full flexibility: you can configure the maximum work session up to 6 hours and customize break tiers, making this ideal for longer, uninterrupted deep-work sessions.
- Mode behavior: Stopwatch-style (counts up); breaks are earned based on accumulated time tiers instead of preset countdowns.
- Best for: deep-focus sessions, creative work, and anyone who wants to earn rest based on effort rather than being forced to stop by a timer.
