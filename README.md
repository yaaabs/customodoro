- **📊 Productivity Analytics** - Track completed sessions and tasks

New: You can now focus on a task by clicking it, and drag & drop tasks to reorder! This makes shifting priorities and concentrating on a single task simple and tactile.

### 📈 **Productivity Graph (NEW!)**
We've expanded our analytics into a new "Stats & Analytics" suite that includes the original Productivity Graph plus several new stats cards to give you deeper insights into your habits.

 **📅 Productivity Graph (Heatmap)** — The original calendar-style heatmap (contribution-graph inspired) showing focus density over time.
  - My Stats: Total Focus Points, Current Streak, Longest Streak
- **📊 User's Stats Card (Dynamic)** — Personalized stats that update when you sign in:
  - Total Focus Time
  - Completed Sessions
  - Most Productive Day
  - Total Classic Pomodoros
  - Total Reverse Pomodoros
- **🔁 Most Used Pomodoro Card** — A small chart showing which Pomodoro type you use most (classic vs reverse vs custom presets).

These cards can be shown together on a dashboard or broken into their own section for advanced users.

### 💾 **Persistent Settings & Data Privacy**
- **🔄 Auto-save Preferences** - Your settings are always remembered
- **🔧 Granular Controls** - Customize every aspect of your timer experience
- **⚡ Quick Reset Options** - Start fresh anytime with one click
- **🔒 Privacy-First** - All data stored locally, no account required

#### Sync Across Devices (Optional)
We provide an opt-in sync feature so you can keep streaks and stats consistent across phones, tablets, and computers. Syncing is optional — the app remains fully functional without an account and stores data locally by default.

How it works:

1️⃣ Register your email on your PC/Laptop to upload your current stats
2️⃣ Sign in with the same email on your iPad/Phone
3️⃣ Your data automatically syncs after each session!

We take safety seriously: synchronization is opt-in and secured (data is uploaded only when you register and sign in). By default data stays local; if you opt into sync, we keep your stats synchronized across devices while providing clear controls for disconnecting and removing synced data.
